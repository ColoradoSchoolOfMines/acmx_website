ACMxLabs.org
============

This is a complete rewrite of the ACMxLabs website in Django 1.7. It should
be up to the same point as the original Django-nonrel app by the first ACMx
meeting of the Fall '14 semester. If you want to work on it, you should
probably wait until then.

## Quick Start

    git clone https://github.com/ColoradoSchoolOfMines/acmx_website.git
    cd acmx_website
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py runserver
