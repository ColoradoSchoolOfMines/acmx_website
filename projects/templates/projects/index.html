            <p>We are the Association for Computing Machinery group on
            campus at the Colorado School of Mines, but we've raised
            our pirate flag and gone adrift.
            <p>We are a group of creators with a heavy focus on
            real-life projects that are relevant to both students and
            industry alike. We work with all disciplines, with members
            from electrical, petroleum, physics, and computer
            engineering.
            <p>We do elementary outreach to increase interest in our
            craft, as well as regularly compete in code competitions to
            sharpen it. Our projects range from wireless mesh parking
            sensor networks, to remote tele-presence robots.
            <p>We are what we create. What else is there?
