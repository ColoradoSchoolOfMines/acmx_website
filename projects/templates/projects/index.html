                        <p>We are the Association for Computing Machinery group on campus at the Colorado School of Mines.</p>
                        <p>We are a group of creators with a heavy focus on real-life projects that are relevant to both students and industry alike. We work with all disciplines, with members from electrical, petroleum, physics, and computer engineering.</p>
                        <p>We do elementary outreach to increase interest in our craft, as well as regularly compete in code competitions to sharpen it. Our projects range from wireless mesh parking sensor networks to remote tele-presence robots. Sign in to add your own projects!</p>
