        <p>ACMx is not only the Colorado School of Mines student branch of the
        Association for Computing Machinery, but also a project-oriented group
        dedicated to improving student life through technology.
        </p>

        <p>Becoming an ACMx member is free, and meetings are held weekly on
        campus when school is in session.  Meetings typically last around 90
        minutes, and are used to plan group events, give project status updates,
        and for project breakout time.  Groups often meet individually for longer
        periods to just work on their projects.
        </p>

        <p>Projects are student-initiated and student-led, funded by the ACMx
        group budget and donations.  To join an ACMx project group, or to propose
        your own project idea, come to a meeting!
        </p>
