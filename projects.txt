Project Title: SmartLots
Description: Real-Time Parking Lot Map
Long Description: The SmartLots project aims to create a real-time web interface to show just how many cars are in a given lot on campus. Using magnetometer sensors and the power of physics, we can figure out when a car enters and leaves a lot. This information is uploaded to a website for easy viewing and made available to anyone. Now you can tell when the CTLM lot is full, rather than waste 5 minutes of gas and time driving around to find that there are no spots. Note: This project is currently undergoing a massive refactor, particularly on the sensor side.
